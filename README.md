# The SUPER COOL Installation
Clone the repo **inside** your minishell folder
```sh
cd minishell
git clone https://github.com/LucasKuhn/minishell_tester.git
cd minishell_tester
```

# How to run
Run the `tester` file to run all the tests for the mandatory part of the project
```sh
./tester
```

# Separate tests
You can also call `./tester` + `test_file` to run only a specific part of the test:
```sh
./tester builtins
```
```sh
./tester pipes
```
```sh
./tester redirects
```
```sh
./tester extras
```

# Manual tests
The tester does **not** test everything. We added some suggestions of manual test in the [manual_tests](manual_tests) folder
- [mandatory](manual_tests/mandatory)
- [heredoc](manual_tests/heredoc)
- [signals](manual_tests/signals)
- [not_mandatory](manual_tests/not_mandatory)

# Bonus
We also have tests for the `wildcards` part of the bonus:
```
./tester wildcards
```
* Make sure your executable is called `minishell_bonus`

# Extra tests
We decided to leave out some tests from the mandatory part, things like syntax errors and OS specific code.

You can run them like any other separate test:
```sh
./tester syntax
```
```sh
./tester os_specific
```
